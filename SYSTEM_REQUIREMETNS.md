Recommended and minimum resources
Minimum (functional with lower FPS, CPU-only yolov8n):
CPU: 4 cores @ 2.5+ GHz
RAM: 8 GB
Disk: 10 GB free (SSD preferred)
GPU: Optional (CPU-only works with reduced FPS)


Recommended (smooth real-time on yolov8m or better):
CPU: 6–8 cores @ 3.0+ GHz
RAM: 16 GB
Disk: 20+ GB free SSD
GPU: NVIDIA 6–8 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 2060/3060), matching CUDA (11.8/12.1)
For best results:
CPU: 8–12 cores modern CPU
RAM: 32 GB
Disk: NVMe SSD
GPU: NVIDIA 8–12 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060/3080/4060)


Other resources that help:
Stable, low-latency network (wired Ethernet) for RTSP cameras
Up-to-date GPU drivers/CUDA
Keep other heavy apps closed to prevent contention
